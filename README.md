# Carbon-Emission-Tracker
Just copy the code into your Python Interpreter to get it running. Or you could just download the "Carbon Emission Tracking.py" file and open it with your Python interpreter to use it!

Please note that you need an OpenAPI key to use the application's "Get Advice" feature. Even without it, the other functions will still work perfectly!

Please note that you might need to install a few modules for the code to work. For this purpose please use the pip install command in the python console.
